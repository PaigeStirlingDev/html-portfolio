<hr />

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Weird as fuck film starring Jim Carey and Kate Winslet. Must watch 10/10!</p>

<h3>Jojo Rabbit</h3>
<p>Dark Comedy. Absolutely spectacular. Five Stars!</p>

<h3>500 Days of Summer</h3>
<p>Like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. Zooey Deschanel = smoking hot. Class soundtrack.</p>
